# Sharkfin Procurement Agency

Brief Introduction

This repository is a project for a business venture my friends and I are running, which will help showcase my web development skills.

# About This Project #sharkfinproc

#sharkfinproc is basically a web development project for a business venture that my partners and I have decided to embark on as a means to create employment for ourselves and make money. As QuachÃ© Tech Studio we took on this project as an opportunity to grow our portfolio and showcase our skills in:
> Web Development
> Web Design
> Copywriting
> Search Engine Optimisation.

This landing page (which will later be grown into a multipaged website later) is a work in progress as well as a marketing tool for our client. Therefore we intent to make it as user friendly as possible while also using the best web development and design available to give our client's users a unique user experience. 

Please follow the journey of how this simple project evolves into a dynamic, beautiful, visual masterpiece.

# Project Goals

The aim of this project is as mentioned above to
> Showcase our skills and grow our portfolio
> Create a optimised and dynamic marketing tool for our client that is visually appealing and providing a great user experience
> To grow our skillet as we challenge and push ourselves beyond our usual limits
